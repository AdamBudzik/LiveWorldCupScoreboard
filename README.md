# Scoreboard Library

The scoreboard supports the following operations:

1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard. This should capture following
   parameters:
   a. Home team
   b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
   total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.
